# @hathq/delivery-server

Provide Hatter product policy and UI over the generic Zixcel delivery host.

## What you can do

- Deliver an initial view with exact source references.
- Connect declared state updates and cancellation.

## Current scope

The current host is owner-local. Public HTTPS, authentication and placement require separate deployment validation.

Package distribution is not activated by this documentation. Use the checked-in source and the declared dependency versions; published availability must be verified separately.

## Getting started

Generic delivery and projection dependencies are available from the public npm registry at the exact declared versions. CI packs only the Hatter product adapters and installs their generic dependencies from the public registry in an isolated consumer. No sibling checkout or historical source repository is needed.

Develop all three packages from this repository root using the single pnpm workspace lockfile. Internal development links resolve only to the current workspace packages; published dependencies retain exact npm versions. The public archive consumer is tested independently from those development links. Use the declared Node.js version:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm test
```

## Release provenance

Starting with 0.10.1, releases use GitHub Actions OIDC trusted publishing from `hathq/delivery-server` (`publish-npm.yml`), without a stored npm publishing token. The workflow verifies reviewed archive hashes and requires npm provenance metadata. Check the published version on npm and verify registry signatures and provenance with `npm audit signatures` in an installed consumer project. Package runtime behavior and API contracts are unchanged by this release.

[OSS responsibility and source completion](docs/oss-source-contract.md) defines the supported package boundary and required acceptance. It does not declare unexecuted source, distribution or production checks complete.

Dependency updates: [repository policy](docs/dependency-updates.md).
Registry releases: [version tags and GitHub OIDC](docs/registry-release.md).
